                                A David Lean epic taking place in WW2 about British POWs led by Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness) tasked 
                                by a Japanese commandante (Sessue Hayakawa) with constructing a bridge over the 
                                titular river. The film explores the tensions within the 
                                prison camp as the population of POWs is split between those willing to comply and others choosing to rebel 
                                against their captors.
